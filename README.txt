RULES AND MECHANICS
-------------------
. The aim of the game is to shoot and dodge your way through waves of enemies and obstacles generated from the background music without dying.

. There are several types of enemies which you may encounter, each with different characteristics.
	- Water Worm : A basic worm. It has the ability to wriggle fast.
	- Earth Worm : A worm with legs. It has the ability to wriggle across the terrain.
	- Air Worm : A worm with wings. It has the ability to fly.

. There are several obstacles which you may encounter, these include:
	- The terrain: Spiky ground.
	- (Cubic) rocks: Floating rocks.
	- Plants/Trees: Growing trees.

. Completing songs/levels unlock weapons which will have features based on your performance and the song/level played. 
	- (Shape, Location, Firerate, Wear)
  These weapons can be inspected and selected within the main menu.
	

. TIPS:
	- Shooting in time (on beat) with the music can give critical hits (3x damage!).
	- Jumping in time (on beat) with the music can give an extra boost in height.
	- Moving backwards and forwards makes the game easier and harder respectively.
	- Shooting "glowing"/"outlined" rocks can replenish the player's HP.
	- Trees hitboxes are outlined with a sphere, only hitting the main branch damages the player.
	- Enemies can regenerate parts of their body as long as their head is still alive.
		. Their heads are naturally tougher than their body parts howerver are not invulnerable to critical hits.
	- The scoring system reflects the player's performance in terms of: Distance travelled, Enemies killed, Health, Shooting accuracy.

. Additional Feature: The player is able to "play the sounds of their environment" via their microphone.
